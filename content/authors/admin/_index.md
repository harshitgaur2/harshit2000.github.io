Hi! I am Harshit Gaur, a senior year undergraduate student at BVP, New Delhi, India. I am currently working as a Software Developer Engineer Intern with the Ezappsolution, New York, USA, and being mentored by Mr. Gaurav Shaindilya. I’m also engaged in research internship at Chandigarh Unversity, under the guidance of Mrs. Meenu Gupta and working on 3D Images Modelling and Geometry Designs for Deep Learning.

In the past, I’ve had experience with working with Deep Learning and Web Development (Django, React) in many projects, some of which are: Automate detection of different emotions from paragraphs and predict overall emotions, Fuzzy Based Expert System for Detection of Breast Cancer, Chatbot for Health Management, Comparative analysis of different models for soil temperature prediction using atmospheric data points and currently working on Deepfake Detection using Optical Flow Technique. 


I’m very interested in research in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, and wish to explore different applications in these fields as I motivate and prepare myself for a career as a researcher and developer.

In my free time, I like to read books, play guitar and work out. I love travelling and trying out different taste of differnet cuisines. I can’t wait to go exploring once this pandemic is done!

I’m actively looking for Software Development Engineer (SDE)/ SWE / Research Assistanships Opportunities starting fall 2021 or 2022. I am currently based in New Delhi, India but I’m open to relocate. Do get in touch with me if you’re up for a chat!
